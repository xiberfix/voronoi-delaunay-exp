# Voronoi diagram & Delaunay triangulation

Experimenting with [Bowyer-Watson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowyer%E2%80%93Watson_algorithm) and data structures to iteratively create [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) and dual [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).
